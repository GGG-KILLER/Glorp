# Glorp

A glorp bot made to reply to questions like a 8ball.

Originally made to be used in Michi's Chop Shop.

I do not provide a single public instance of it because I don't want to waste processing power with other guilds.

## Setup

Just run it with an environment variable called `GLORP_Discord__Token` with the bot token to be used and that's it.
